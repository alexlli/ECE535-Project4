# ECE535-Project4
Federated Learning on Multimodal Sensor Data

# Motivation
- Learn about Federated Learning (FL) and its application in multimodal IoT data. 
- Learn how Federated Learning affects privacy
- Learn how to setup machine learning programming environments
- Learn how to train a model and analyze the results

# Design goals
- Implement Federated Learning models
- Validate the results in the paper [1]

# Deliverables
Deliverables in Github include:
- Source code of model in Python
- Setup instructions
- Reference dataset and new dataset set with balanced class distribution
- Results of model runs
- Docs and presentations


# Software Requirements
- Anaconda 3
- Python 3.7+
- Pytorch 1.8+
- Torchvision 0.9+
- Numpy 1.19+
- Matplotlib 3.3+
- Scipy 1.4+
- MPI for Python 3.0+

# Hardware Requirements

# Project timeline
Week 1-2: Preparation and Planning
Literature Review, Software Setup

Week 3-4: Model training and collecting results
Running model code and train model on sample data
Collect results for analysis

Week 5-6: Model Evaluation
Conduct per-class accuracy analysis
Observe the effect of skewed data distribution on the per-class accuracy

Week 8-9: Design new data sets and rerun models
Design a multimodal dataset that is relatively balanced in class distribution
Rerun models on the new data set

Week 9-10: Writing
Documentation, Final Report, Presentation
